As shown in the main file the results are not very good, but this wasn't the main objetive of this project.
Our objetive was to design the neural network and to implement the CNN, LSTM and Autoencoder layers all together, 
it was a very difficult task and we have laernt a lot about Machine Learning and Tensorflow.

Another big obstacle we had is how to train the model, we had to use the Keras Video Generator and make a generator 
inside a generator because if we loaded all the images directly on Colab the RAM stopped and runtyme was reset.

Although we are very proud of designing this model, make it trainable and be able to get some predictions we know still
ther is a lot of work to do to get some good results. Our next idea is to use Transformers instead of LSTM, it looks this 
kind of models have a lot of potential in these tasks.
